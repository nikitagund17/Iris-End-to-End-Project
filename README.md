URL for app - [https://iris-project-nikitagund.streamlit.app/](https://iris-project-nikitagund.streamlit.app/)

This project is a part of my Data Science and Analytics course at ETLHive Pune. It involves predicting species using the famous Iris dataset. The project is developed in Python and includes a Streamlit web application for easy interaction.

## Features:
- Input sepal and petal measurements to get species predictions
- View probabilities of predictions
- Model built using Logistic Regression
- Evaluation using confusion matrix and classification report
- Cross-validation for model performance assessment

## Project Structure:
- **app.py:** Streamlit web application code
- **requirements.txt:** List of Python packages required for the project
- **notebook/:** Jupyter Notebook containing model creation steps
- **preprocessor.pkl:** Preprocessor saved using pickle for data transformation
- **model.pkl:** Trained Logistic Regression model saved using pickle

## Installation:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-end-to-end-project.git
   cd iris-end-to-end-project
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage:
1. Run the Streamlit web application:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. Input sepal and petal measurements to predict species.

## Deployment:
The project is deployed using Streamlit and can be accessed [here](https://iris-project-nikitagund.streamlit.app/).

Feel free to explore the project and provide feedback!
